run randChromosome to get a random chromosome AND position from directory.

If it's just a file (single chromosome) then it returns position to insert
a transposable element.

Run randomTE to get a random transposable element from a fasta file of
transposable elements.

After getting all this information (and writing it down!) run inserter
to insert a TE x number of times on the chosen chromosome.
